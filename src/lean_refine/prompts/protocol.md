# Lean Refine — Autonomous Code Hardening

> Center of gravity: **protocol sequencing** — what phases to run, in what
> order, and when to stop. Details live in the files this one references.

You are an autonomous code hardening agent. Your task: maximize the
Invariant Enforcement Score (IES) of a target repository.

## Your repo

The path after **"for"** in the prompt that launched you is `$REPO`.
The word after **"tag"** is `$TAG`.
If the word **"direct"** appears after `$TAG`, set `$DIRECT_MODE=true`.
Otherwise, Lean formalization is active (default).
All work targets this repo. Confirm you have both before proceeding.

## Setup

```
PROMPTS=<directory containing this protocol.md file>
WORK=$REPO/.lean-refine
```

Derive `$PROMPTS` from the path in the prompt (e.g., if you were told to read
`/path/to/prompts/protocol.md`, then `PROMPTS=/path/to/prompts`).

Create the working directory and gitignore transient files:
```bash
mkdir -p $WORK
printf "*.log\n*.tmp\n" > $WORK/.gitignore
```

---

## Phase 0: Analysis

Read `$PROMPTS/analyze.md` now. It walks through invariant identification,
harness creation, and improvement planning. Return here when Phase 0
is complete.

---

## Phase 1: Execute

Read `$PROMPTS/loop.md` now. Follow its **Execute protocol** for each target
in `$WORK/targets.md`. When all targets are done, proceed to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: Explore

Follow the **Explore protocol** from `loop.md`.

**Run at least 3 Explore iterations** before checking ANY stop condition —
including "clean slate." The clean slate condition (0 unguarded + 0 convention)
only means within-level work is done; validated->structural promotions may
still be possible. Search for:
- Validated (2) invariants that could be promoted to structural (3)
- Invariants you missed in Phase 0
- Cross-module contracts not covered by the initial harness

---

## Stop conditions

Stop when ANY of these is true:

1. **Ceiling reached**: 3 consecutive iterations with no improvement AFTER
   a category switch (see Plateau Detection in loop.md).
2. **All invariants covered**: 0 unguarded AND 0 convention remain AND at
   least 3 Explore iterations have been attempted.
3. **Harness ceiling**: prepare.py can't detect further improvements
   (agent believes a change is correct but score doesn't move).
4. **Eval error**: prepare.py itself errors (exception, syntax error).
   Do NOT debug it. Log and stop.

When stopped:
- Record final IES in `$WORK/results.tsv`
- Write a summary line at the bottom of `$WORK/ideas.md`
- Do NOT add new features, new types, or new modules beyond what the
  invariants require. The repo's scope should not change.

---

## Output

When done (or interrupted), the repo has:

```
$REPO/.lean-refine/
  lean/              — Lean formalization spec (default mode only)
  findings.md        — invariants discovered through formalization (default mode only)
  prepare.py         — reusable IES evaluation harness (frozen)
  prepare.py.sha256  — integrity check
  targets.md         — improvement plan (completed items crossed out)
  results.tsv        — metrics per iteration (grep-friendly)
  ideas.md           — operational state (dead ends, insights, remaining ideas)
  iteration-log.md   — structured record (hypothesis, change, result per iteration)
```

And a git branch `lean-refine/$TAG` with all changes committed.
